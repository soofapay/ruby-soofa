## Usage
##### 1. Checking for a transaction
```ruby
require 'soofapay'

soofa = Soofa.new("your_till_number", 'your_client_secret')
puts "soofa balance is:  ",soofa.get_balance.class
exist = soofa.find("QTMB6")
if exist
  @trx = soofa.get_transaction
  puts @trx.tid
  puts @trx.gross_amount
  puts @trx.as_json['reference']
  puts @trx.as_string
end

```
The expected response for transaction check is  `Transaction` 
object with various keys and methods

There is an additional method for getting the entire JSON object.

> transaction.json()

```JSON
{
    "status": "SUCCESSFUL",
